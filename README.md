PREDICTING CAR PRICE USING MACHINE LEARNING - REGRESSI3N PR0JECT

• Develop a Model to predict car prices on the basis of given data. Used Data 
Exploration and Data Cleaning techniques to understand the data better.'

• Prepare Data for model building by using data splitting techniques. Use Feature 
Scaling to normalize the data.'

• Use algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision trees to predict the resultant 
variable and achieve 88% accuracy.
